## Data
The data for this project was scraped from bvbinfo.com. It contains all AVP matchces from 2013 onward. FIVB matches will be added in the future as well.

## Ratings
The ratings have been calculated using the Glicko 2 method, a common method used for rating chess players.  More information on the Gllicko method can be found here: http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html. A few small adjustments have been made so that the rating system can accomomadate two individuals on a team.
